# quiz

This is a project I worked on a few years ago purely for use with my family. It's a very simple quiz web app using the API provided by the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/).

There is no scoring or category selection, though these are things I may decide to add in the future.

You can have a go at the quiz at https://jamiethomas1.github.io/quiz
